# Newsprint-Theme
The WP theme I use for my main blog. I'll be tracking and planning here. Never do this without a gameplan, no matter how 
long it takes to come up with one in the first place.

## Design
While I won't talk about it much in this README, design is a key concept here. It's meant to be simple. I used to dream of being an author, so my goal is to trap that dream and the essence of it to where I do write content. By doing that, I keep the dream alive while working my day job as a programmer. Also, I feel someone more qualified at the job could benefit off this more than myself.
